Definitions 
Throughout this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated, 
the following words have the meanings given to them below: 

a) “Account” means your Checking Account, Money Market 
Account, personal CD Account and/or Savings Account with us, 
including Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), as applicable, 
unless limited by the heading under which it appears. 

b) “Business Day” means every day, except Saturdays, Sundays, 
and federal holidays. 

c) “Calendar Day” means every day, including Saturdays, 
Sundays, and federal holidays. 

d) “Bank,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “TD Bank” refer to 
TD Bank, N.A. 

e) “You” and “your” mean each depositor who opens an 
Account, and any joint owner of each Account. 

f) “Store” means a branch office. 

Part I: Personal Deposit Account Terms 
and Conditions 
By opening and maintaining an Account with the Bank, you 
agree to the provisions of this Agreement, so you should read this 
Agreement thoroughly and keep it with other important records. 
From time to time, we may offer new types of Accounts and may 
cease offering some types of Accounts. This Agreement governs 
all of these new types of Accounts, and continues to govern any 
Accounts you may have that we no longer offer. If and to the 
extent the provisions of this Agreement vary from the provisions 
of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the jurisdiction 
where your Account was opened, the terms and conditions of 
this Agreement shall control. 

This Agreement includes your promise to pay the charges listed on 
the Personal Fee Schedule and Account Maintenance Information 
grid and your permission for us to deduct these charges, as 
earned, directly from your Account. You also agree to pay any 
additional reasonable charges we may impose for services you 
request which are not contemplated by this Agreement but are 
disclosed in our Personal Fee Schedule which may be amended 
from time to time. Each of you agrees to be jointly and severally 
liable for any Account deficit resulting from charges or overdrafts, 
whether caused by you or another authorized to withdraw from 
your Account, together with the costs we incur to collect the 
deficit, including, to the extent permitted by law, our reasonable 
attorneys’ fees. 

You agree to use the Account only for lawful purposes, and you 
acknowledge and agree that “restricted transactions” as defined 
in the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 
and Regulation GG issued thereunder are prohibited from being 
processed through your Account or any relationship between 
you and the Bank. In the event we identify a suspected restricted 

transaction, we may block or otherwise prevent or prohibit such 
transaction; and further, we may deny services to you, close the 
Account, or end the relationship. However, in the event that a 
charge or transaction described in this disclosure is approved and 
processed, you will still be liable for the charge. In order to protect 
you, we may ask for identification or may ask identifying questions 
to authenticate you prior to processing a request or transaction. 

Deposit Policy 
We may refuse to accept an item for deposit or to return all or a 
part of it to you. Any item that we accept for deposit is subject 
to later verification. We will usually give you provisional credit for 
items deposited into your Account. However, we may delay or 
refuse to give you provisional credit if we believe in our discretion 
that your item will not be paid. We will reverse any provisional 
credit we have given for an item deposited into your Account 
if we do not receive final credit for that item and charge you a 
fee (see Personal Fee Schedule). If the reversal of a provisional 
credit creates an overdraft in your Account, you will owe us the 
amount of the overdraft, plus any overdraft fees (see Personal 
Fee Schedule). We will determine when final credit is received for 
any item. Please read the Funds Availability Policy for a detailed 
discussion of how and when we make funds available to you. 

We will accept certain items like foreign checks and bond coupons 
for collection only. You may also ask us to accept certain other 
items for collection only. You will not receive credit for (provisional 
or otherwise), and may not withdraw funds against, any of these 
items until we receive final credit from the person responsible for 
paying them. Items sent for collection will be credited to your 
Account in U.S. dollars, with the amount of U.S. dollars credited 
calculated using our applicable exchange rate that is in effect on 
the date when we credit the funds to your Account and not when 
the deposit is made. We may earn revenue on this exchange.The 
Funds Availability Policy does not apply to items we have accepted 
for collection only. If and when we receive final credit for an item 
we have accepted for collection only, you agree that we may 
subtract our collection fee (see Personal Fee Schedule) from the 
amount finally credited to us, before we credit your Account for 
the remaining amount. 

Checks 
All negotiable paper (called “checks”) presented for payment 
must be in a form supplied by or previously approved by the 
Bank. The Bank may refuse to accept any check that does not 
meet this requirement or which is incompletely or defectively 
drawn. Once an outstanding check is six (6) months old, we may 
elect not to pay it. But if there is no stop payment order on file 
when we receive the check for payment, we may elect to pay it 
in good faith without consulting you. You agree that you will use 
care in safeguarding your unsigned checks against loss or theft. 
You will tell us immediately if any checks are missing. You agree

to assume all losses that could have been prevented if you had 
safeguarded unsigned (or otherwise incomplete) checks, or had 
told us they were missing. 

Returned Checks/Waiver of Rights 
If you deposit a check or item in your Account that the drawee 
bank returns unpaid for any reason (called “dishonor”), we may 
put the check or item through for collection again. This means 
that you are waiving your right to receive immediate notice of 
dishonor. If the check or item is dishonored for any reason, the 
amount of the dishonored check or item will be deducted from 
your Account. You agree to pay the Bank a fee for any such 
check or item that is dishonored (see Personal Fee Schedule). The 
Bank may also collect any amounts due to the Bank because of 
returned checks, through the right of set-off, from any other of 
your Accounts at the Bank, or collect the funds directly from you. 

Cashing of Checks 
Typically, the Bank will cash checks drawn on other banks 
for its Customers who have adequate available funds in their 
Account(s). If any such check should be returned by the 
paying bank for any reason, the Bank will charge you a fee 
(see Personal Fee Schedule). In addition, the Bank will debit 
the amount of the returned check from your Account(s). 
If the debit creates an overdraft in your Account, you will 
owe us the amount of the overdraft plus any overdraft fees 
(see Personal Fee Schedule). 

Withdrawal Policy 
Passbook Account (if available in your jurisdiction) withdrawals 
can be made by an authorized signer only upon presentation 
of the passbook, either in person or accompanied by a written 
order of withdrawal. If you lose the passbook, we require that a 
Lost Passbook Affidavit be signed by ALL persons named on the 
Account before a notary public. 

Statement Savings Account withdrawals can be made per written 
order of withdrawal in accordance with the information contained 
on the signature card and may also be made with an ATM or 
Visa® Debit Card, as applicable. The Bank may refuse a request 
if any document or identification required by the Bank or law in 
connection with the withdrawal has not been presented. 

The Bank reserves the right to require seven (7) Calendar Days 
written notice prior to withdrawal or transfer of funds from all 
Savings or Money Market Accounts offered by the Bank. 

For any Statement Savings Account(s) (including Money Market 
Accounts), you may make as many in-person withdrawals at 
a teller window or any ATM as you wish. However, federal 
regulations permit the depositor to make no more than a 
combined total of six (6) pre-authorized, automatic, electronic 
(including computer initiated), telephone withdrawals or transfers, 
or payments by check, draft, debit card, or similar order payable 

to third parties in any monthly period (based on your statement 
date). We may impose a fee, as disclosed on the Personal Fee 
Schedule, for each such withdrawal in excess of six (6) that you 
make in any monthly period (based on your statement date). 
These fees will be reflected in your monthly statement. In addition, 
repeated violations will result in the Account being closed or 
changed from a savings type Account to a transaction Account. 

For Holiday Club and Club Saver Accounts, we may impose a fee, 
as disclosed on the Personal Fee Schedule, for each withdrawal in 
excess of three (3) that you make in any calendar month. 

Processing Order for Payment of Checks, Debit Card 
Transactions, and Other Items 
The following describes how we pay or charge to your Account 
checks, debit card transactions, and other items presented for 
payment or deposit. An “item” includes a check, substitute check, 
purported substitute check, remotely created check or draft, 
electronic transaction, draft, demand draft, image replacement 
document, indemnified copy, ATM withdrawal or transfer, 
debit card point-of-sale transaction, pre-authorized debit card 
payment, automatic transfer, telephone-initiated transfer, ACH 
transaction, online banking transfer to or from Accounts at 
TD Bank or external transfers to other institutions, online bill 
payment instruction, payment to or from other people (Send 
Money with Zelle® transaction), withdrawal or deposit slip, in-
person transfer or withdrawal, cash ticket, deposit adjustment, 
wire transfer, and any other instruction or order for the payment, 
transfer, deposit or withdrawal of funds. 

For purposes of determining your available Account balance and 
processing items to your Account, including returning items due 
to insufficient funds or paying items that overdraw your Account, 
all items are processed overnight at the end of each Business 
Day (which excludes Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays). 
Each Business Day, your starting available Account balance is 
determined in accordance with our Funds Availability Policy. 
Please read the Funds Availability Policy for a detailed discussion 
of how and when we make funds available to you. 

For (i) Checking Accounts and (ii) Money Market Accounts 
with check access, items are processed as follows: 

a) First, items, including both deposits and withdrawals, are 
added to and deducted from your available Account balance 
in chronological date and time order based on the information 
that we receive for each item. The following transaction fees 
also will be deducted in date and time order based on when 
they are assessed: wire transfer fees, deposit return fees, 
returned item fees, and overdraft fees. For some items, we do 
not receive date and time information. We assign these items 
a date and time, which may vary from when the transactions 
were conducted.  All checks drawn upon your account that 
are not cashed at a TD Bank Store are assigned a time of

11pm on the date we receive them.  If multiple items have the 
same date and time information, they will be processed in the 
following order: (i) deposits first; (ii) checks drawn upon your 
account next, from lowest to highest check number, and then 
(iii) other withdrawals, from lowest to highest dollar amount. 
For purposes of this section (a), withdrawals include 
transactions that have been presented for payment as well as 
pending debit card, ATM or electronic transactions that have 
been authorized but not yet presented to us for payment. 
Please see the additional details below for more information 
regarding pending transactions. Deposits are made available 
to you in accordance with our Funds Availability Policy. 

b) Second, we add to or deduct from your available Account 
balance any interest credits or fees not described in (a) above. 
Examples of these fees include non-TD ATM fees, monthly 
maintenance fees, and overdraft protection transfer fees.  

For (i) Savings Accounts, (ii) Money Market Accounts with 
no check access, and (iii) CD Accounts, items are processed 
as follows: 

a) First, deposits that have become available to you that Business 
Day in accordance with our Funds Availability Policy are added 
to your available Account balance. 

b) Next, the total amount of any “pending” debit card, ATM and 
other electronic transactions that have been authorized but 
not yet presented to us for payment is deducted from your 
available Account balance. Please see the additional details 
below for more information regarding pending transactions. 

c) We then deduct items from your available Account balance 
by category, in the following order: 

i. Outgoing wire transfers, return deposit items, and debit 
adjustments to your available Account balance; 

ii. Overdraft fees, other returned item fees, and deposit 
return fees; 

iii. All other Account fees (except as described in (iv) below), 
and all other items including checks, ATM transactions, 
and debit card transactions; and 

iv. Fees assessed at the end of the statement cycle including, 
for example but not limited to, monthly maintenance fees. 

Within categories i, ii, and iii, we post items in order from 
highest to lowest dollar amount. 

Additional details regarding pending transactions for 
all Accounts: 

When you use a debit card, ATM card, or other electronic means 
to make withdrawals, we may receive notice of the transaction 
before it is actually presented to us for payment. That notice 
may be in the form of a merchant authorization request or 
other electronic inquiry. Upon receipt of such notice, we treat 

the transaction as “pending” at the time we receive notice, 
and subject to certain exceptions, we deduct the amount of the 
pending transactions from your available Account balance to 
determine the amount available to pay other items presented 
against your Account. The amount of a pending transaction 
may not be equal to the amount of the actual transaction that is 
subsequently presented for payment and posted to your Account. 
If a pending transaction is not presented for payment within three 
(3) Business Days after we receive notice of the transaction, we 
will release the amount of the pending transaction. We do not 
deduct the amount of pending debit card transactions from your 
available Account balance for certain categories of merchants 
that frequently request authorization for amounts in excess of 
the likely transaction amount, including hotels and resorts, airlines 
and cruise lines, car rental companies, and automated gas pumps 
(pay at the pump). 

Additional details regarding our processing order of items 
for all Accounts: 

The order in which items are processed may affect the total 
amount of overdraft fees incurred. See “Overdrafts” below, as 
well as the Personal Fee Schedule, for more information. 

We may from time to time change the order in which we accept, 
pay or charge items to your Account even if (a) paying a particular 
item results in an insufficient available balance in your Account to 
pay one or more other items that otherwise could have been paid 
out of your Account; or (b) using a particular order results in the 
payment of fewer items or the imposition of additional overdraft 
fees. If we do change our processing order for checks and other 
items presented for payment from your Account, we will provide 
advance notice of the change. Please call 1-888-751-9000 for 
additional information about our processing order. 

Reasons Why We May Refuse to Pay an Item: 
a) is illegible; 

b) is drawn in an amount greater than the amount of funds 
then available for withdrawal in your Account (see the Funds 
Availability Policy) or which would, if paid, create an overdraft; 

c) bears a duplicate check number; 

d) we believe has been altered; 

e) we believe is otherwise not properly payable; or 

f) we believe does not bear an authorized signature. 

We are not required to honor any restrictive legend on checks you  
write unless we have agreed in writing to the restriction. Examples  
of restrictive legends are “Not Valid For More Than $1000”, “Void  
If Not Negotiated Within 30 Days of Issuance”, and the like. 

Postdated Items 
You agree that when you write a check you will not date the check 
in the future. If you do and the check is presented for payment 
before the date of the check, we may either pay it or return it 

8 9 



 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 
 
 
 

    
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unpaid. You agree that if we pay the check, the check will be 
posted to your Account on the day we pay the check. You further 
agree that we are not responsible for any loss to you in doing so. 

Pre-authorized Drafts 
If you voluntarily give information about your Account (such as 
our routing number and your Account number) to a party who 
is seeking to sell you goods or services, and you do not physically 
deliver a check to the party, any debit to your Account initiated 
by the party to whom you gave the information is deemed 
authorized by you. 

Overdrafts 
An overdraft is an advance of funds that exceeds your available 
Account balance, made by us to you, at our sole discretion. 
Overdrafts may include, but are not limited to, advances to cover 
a check, in-person withdrawal, ATM withdrawal, debit card point-
of-sale transaction, or a withdrawal by other electronic means 
from your Account. We may demand immediate repayment of 
any overdraft and charge you an overdraft fee (see Personal Fee 
Schedule). 

For (i) Checking Accounts and (ii) Money Market Accounts with 
check access, you will not be charged an overdraft fee on items 
presented for payment that result in your available Account 
balance being overdrawn by $5 or less.  Overdraft fees may 
be charged on items presented for payment regardless of your 
available Account balance at the end of the day.  

Overdraft fees are not charged on “pending” transactions, 
although pending transactions reduce your available Account 
balance to pay other transactions and may result in the assessment 
of overdraft fees for those transactions. Overdraft fees may be 
charged on any item, including checks and debit card transactions 
(see “Important Information for Consumers about your TD Bank 
Checking Account” brochure for more information).  

You agree to pay us, when we ask you, all of our costs of collecting 
an overdraft, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 
These costs include, but are not limited to, our legal fees and 
expenses. If more than one of you owns an Account, each of 
you will be responsible for paying us the entire amount of all 
overdrafts and obligations resulting from the overdrafts. 

We do not have to allow you to make an overdraft. It may 
be a crime to intentionally withdraw funds from an Account 
when there are not enough funds in the Account to cover 
the withdrawal or when the funds are not yet available for 
withdrawal. 

Stop Payments 
At your request and risk, the Bank will accept a stop payment 
request for a check on your Account for a fee (see Personal 
Fee Schedule). To be effective, a stop payment request must 
be received in such timely manner so as to give the Bank a 

reasonable opportunity to act on it, and must precisely identify 
the Account number, check number, date and amount of the 
item, and the payee. 

Your stop payment request will be effective after the request has 
been received by the Bank and the Bank has had a reasonable 
opportunity to act on it. Regardless of whether your stop payment 
request has been made orally or in writing, it will remain in effect 
for one (1) year from the date it was given. If your stop payment 
request has been made orally, the Bank will send you a written 
confirmation. If your stop payment request is made in writing, 
you must use a form that is supplied by the Bank; this form will 
constitute written confirmation of your request. In either case, it 
is your responsibility to ensure that all of the information supplied 
on your written confirmation is correct and to promptly inform 
the Bank of any inaccuracies. 

To maintain the validity of the stop payment request for more than 
one (1) year, you must furnish a new stop payment request that 
is confirmed in writing as described in the preceding paragraph 
before the expiration of the one (1) year period. If a new stop 
payment request is not received, the check may be paid. 

We are not liable for failing to stop payment if you have not given 
us sufficient information or if your stop payment request comes 
too late for us to act on it. We are entitled to a reasonable period 
of time after we receive your stop payment request to notify our 
employees and take other action needed to stop payment. You 
agree that “reasonable time” depends on the circumstances but 
that we will have acted within a reasonable time if we make your 
stop payment request effective by the end of the next Business 
Day following the Business Day on which we receive your stop 
payment request. If we stop payment, you agree to defend and 
pay any claims raised against us as a result of our refusal to pay 
the check or other item on which you stopped payment. 

If we recredit your Account after we have paid a check or other 
item over a valid and timely stop order, you agree to sign a 
statement describing the dispute you have with the person to 
whom the check or item was made payable. You also agree to 
transfer to us all of your rights against the payee and any other 
holder, endorser or prior transferee of the check or item and to 
cooperate with us in any legal action taken to collect against 
the other person(s). 

If we are liable for inadvertently paying your check over a stop 
payment order, you must establish the amount of your loss 
caused by our payment of the check. We will pay you only the 
amount of the loss, up to the face amount of the check. You 
agree that we shall not be liable for any punitive, exemplary or 
consequential damages. 

The Bank has no duty to stop payment on a cashier’s check, 
teller’s check or other similar item because items of this type are 
not drawn on your Account. The Bank may, in its sole discretion,

attempt to stop payment on a cashier’s check, teller’s check or 
other similar item if you certify to our satisfaction that the item 
has been lost, stolen or destroyed. You must also furnish any other 
documents or information we may require, which may include 
your affidavit attesting to the facts and your indemnification of 
the Bank. Even if the Bank agrees to attempt to stop payment on 
a cashier’s check, teller’s check or other similar item, if the item is 
presented for payment, the Bank may pay it and you will be liable 
to us for that item, unless otherwise required by applicable law. 

For information on Stop Payments as they pertain to pre-
authorized funds transfers, please reference the Pre-authorized 
(Recurring) Transfers and Stop Payments section within Part IV: 
Electronic Funds Transfers Disclosure. 

International, ACH, The Clearing House Real-Time 
Payments (“TCH RTP”) and Wire Transactions 
If your Account receives incoming ACH transactions (either credits 
or debits), RTP transfers, or wire transfers initiated from within 
or outside of the United States, both you and we are subject to 
the Operating Rules and Guidelines of the National Automated 
Clearing House Association (“NACHA”), the The Clearing House 
Real-Time Payments (TCH RTP) Operating Rules,” or the rules 
of any wire transfer system involved, and the laws enforced by 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). You must not 
send or receive RTP transfers on behalf of a person who is not a 
resident of, or otherwise domiciled in, the United States. Under 
such rules and laws, we may temporarily suspend processing of 
a transaction for greater scrutiny or verification against the OFAC 
list of blocked parties, which may result in delayed settlement, 
posting and/or availability of funds. If we determine there is a 
violation, or if we cannot satisfactorily resolve a suspected or 
potential violation, the subject funds will be blocked as required 
by law. If you believe you have adequate grounds to seek the 
return of any blocked funds, it is your sole responsibility to pursue 
the matter with the appropriate governmental authorities. Please 
see the OFAC website for procedures and form required to seek 
a release of blocked funds. 

We may impose a fee, as disclosed on the Personal Fee Schedule, 
for any domestic or international incoming wire transactions. 
Wire transfers in a foreign currency will be converted at our rate 
of exchange on the day the transaction completed and we may 
earn revenue on this exchange. 

Periodic Statements; Time Limit to Report Errors 
If your Account is not a Holiday Club, Club Saver, IRA, Passbook or 
CD Account, the Bank will provide you with a periodic statement. 
Unless you tell us of a change of address, we will continue to mail 
or deliver electronically statements or any other notices to your 
address as it appears on our records and you will be considered to 
have received those statements and any other notices sent to you 
at that address. We do not have to send you a statement or notice 
if (i) you do not claim your statement, (ii) we cannot deliver your 
statement or notice because of your instructions or your failure to 

tell us that you have changed your address, or (iii) we determine that 
your Checking Account has been inactive for more than 6 months 
or your Savings Account has been inactive for more than 9 months. 

You should review your statements and balance your Account 
promptly after you receive them or, if we are holding them for 
you, promptly after we make them available to you. If you don’t 
receive an Account statement by the date when you usually 
receive it, call us at once. You must review your statements to 
make sure that there are no errors in the Account information. 

On Accounts with check-writing privileges, you must review your 
statement and imaged copies of paid checks, if any, we send you 
and report forgeries, alterations, missing signatures, amounts 
differing from your records, or other information that might lead 
you to conclude that the check was forged or that, when we paid 
the check, the proper amount was not paid to the proper person. 
You have this duty even if we do not return checks to you or we 
return only an image of the check. You should notify us as soon 
as possible if you think there is a problem. 

Applicable law and this Agreement require you to discover and 
report  any  error  in  payment  of a  check  within specified  time  
periods. You agree that statements and any images of paid checks  
accompanying the statement shall be deemed to be “available” 
to you as of the statement mailing date, or the date on which 
electronic statements are available for viewing. If we are holding 
your Account statements for you at your request, the statements 
become “available” on the day they are available for you to  
pick up. This means, for example, that the period in which you 
must report any problem with an Account begins on the day we 
make the statement available, even if you do not pick up the 
statement until later. 

If you assert against us a claim that an item was not properly 
payable because, for example, the item was forged or an 
endorsement was forged, you must cooperate with us and 
assist us in seeking criminal and civil penalties against the 
person responsible. You agree to assist TD Bank, N.A. and law 
enforcement authorities as needed in any investigation and if 
needed, to serve as a witness at any hearing, proceeding or 
action brought against the person(s) responsible for the forgery. 
If we ask, you also must give us a statement, under oath, about 
the facts and circumstances relating to your claim. If you fail or 
refuse to do these things, we will consider that you have ratified 
the defect in the item and agree that we may charge the full 
amount of the item to your Account. 

You must notify us as soon as possible if you believe there 
is an error, forgery or other problem with the information 
shown on your Account statement. You agree that thirty 
(30) Calendar Days after we mailed a statement (or 
otherwise made it available to you) is a reasonable amount 
of time for you to review your Account statement and 
report any errors, forgeries or other problems. In addition, 
you agree not to assert a claim against us concerning any 

12 13 



 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error, forgery or other problem relating to a matter shown 
on an Account statement unless you notified us of the error, 
forgery or other problem within thirty (30) Calendar Days 
after we mailed you the statement (or otherwise made it 
available to you). This means, for example, that you cannot 
bring a lawsuit against us, even if we are at fault, for 
paying checks bearing a forgery of your signature unless 
you reported the forgery within thirty (30) Calendar Days 
after we mailed you the statement (or otherwise made it 
available to you) listing the check we paid. 

There are exceptions to this 30 day notice requirement. For 
claims asserting forged, missing or unauthorized endorsement 
or alteration, you must notify us within the period specified by 
the state law applicable to your account. We may destroy original 
checks not less than thirty (30) Calendar Days after the statement 
mailing date or electronic delivery date. We will retain copies of 
the front and back of the checks on microfilm or other media for 
a period of seven (7) years. During that period, we will provide 
you an imaged copy of any paid check on request, but we need 
not do so thereafter. You agree not to make any claim against us 
arising out of the authorized destruction of your original checks 
or the clarity or legibility of any copy we provide. 

Combined Statements with Checking 
If more than one Checking type Account is combined together 
on a monthly statement, then only one Checking Account can 
be designated as the primary Account. This primary Account 
may receive imaged copies of the paid checks back with the 
statement, and we may impose a fee as disclosed on the Personal 
Fee Schedule, for providing these imaged copies. Checks for all 
other Accounts will be retained by the Bank. To request a copy 
of a paid check, please call 1-888-751-9000. 

Please note that a Health Savings Account cannot be included 
on a combined statement. 

Important Information for Opening a New Account 
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money 
laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person 
who opens an Account. When you open an Account, we will ask 
for your name, legal address, date of birth, Social Security or Tax 
Identification Number, and other information that will allow us 
to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or 
any other identifying documents. 

Telephone Numbers 
If you give a cell phone number directly to us, you consent to 
and agree to accept calls related to the servicing of your Account 
to your cell phone from us and our agents. For any service related 
telephone or cell phone calls placed to you by us or our agents, 
you consent and agree that those calls may be automatically 
dialed and/or may consist of pre-recorded messages. 

Account Ownership 
The following provisions explain the rules applicable to your 
Account depending on the form of ownership specified on the 
signature card. Only the portion corresponding to the form of 
ownership specified will apply. 

Individual Accounts 
An individual Account is issued to one person who does not intend 
(merely by opening the Account) to create any survivorship rights 
for any other person. 

Joint Accounts – With Right of Survivorship 
A joint Account is issued in the name of two or more persons. If 
more than one of you opens an Account and signs a signature 
card as a co-owner of the Account, the Account is a joint Account 
with right of survivorship. Each of you intends that, upon your 
death, the balance in the Account (subject to any previous pledge 
to which we have consented) will belong to the survivor(s), and we 
may continue to honor checks or orders drawn by, or withdrawal 
requests from, the survivor(s) after the death of any owner(s). 
If two or more of you survive, you will own the balance in the 
Account as joint tenants with right of survivorship. 

The following rules apply to all joint Accounts: 

a) Deposits: All deposits are the property of all of the owners 
of the Account. Each owner of a joint Account agrees that 
we may credit to the joint Account any check or other item 
which is payable to the order of any one or more of you, even 
if the check or other item is endorsed by less than all or none 
of you. We may supply endorsements as allowed by law on 
checks or other items that you deposit to the Account. For 
certain checks, such as those payable by the government, 
we may require all payees to endorse the check for deposit. 

b) Orders: The Bank may release all or any part of the balance 
of the Account to honor checks, withdrawals, orders, or 
requests signed by any owner of the Account. Any one of 
you may close the Account. We may be required by service of 
legal process to hold or remit funds held in a joint Account to 
satisfy an attachment or judgment entered against, or other 
valid debt incurred by, any owner of the Account. None of you 
may instruct us to take away any of the rights of another. If 
there is a dispute among you, you must resolve it yourselves 
and the Bank does not have to recognize that dispute in the 
absence of any valid court order. Unless we receive written 
notice signed by any owner not to pay any joint deposit, we 
shall not be liable to any owner for continuing to honor checks 
or other orders drawn by, or withdrawal requests from, any 
owner; after receipt of any such written notice, we shall not 
be liable to any owner for refusing to pay any checks or honor 
any orders and we may require the written authorization of 
any or all owners for any further payments.

c) Liability: Co-owners of a joint Account are jointly and 
severally liable for activity on this Account. In the event of any 
overdrafts on a joint Account, the joint owners agree that each 
owner shall be jointly and severally liable for the overdrafts in 
the joint Account, whether or not any particular owner: (a) 
created the overdraft, (b) had knowledge of the overdraft, 
(c) was involved in or participated in activity in the Account, 
or (d) derived any benefit from the overdraft. 

No Two-Signer Accounts 
We do not offer Accounts on which two or more signatures 
are required for a check or other withdrawal. Notwithstanding 
any provisions to the contrary on any signature card or other 
agreement you have with us, you agree that if any Account 
purports to require two or more signers on items drawn on or 
withdrawals from the Account, such provision is solely for your 
internal control purposes and is not binding on us. If more than 
one person is authorized to write checks or draw items on your 
Account, you agree that we can honor checks signed by any 
Authorized Signer, even if there are two or more lines on the items 
for your signature and two signatures are required. 

Specialty Accounts 
TD Bank offers accounts providing benefits to specific 
demographics. The following provisions explain the rules to these 
specialty accounts. 

a) TD Convenience Checking: TD Convenience Checking 
for students and young adults: TD Convenience Checking 
accounts provide a monthly maintenance fee waiver for 
primary account owners age 17 through 23.  If you are under 
the age of 18, you must open a joint account with a parent 
or legal guardian as the secondary owner. The monthly 
maintenance fee waiver benefits expire upon the primary 
account owner’s 24th birthday at which time the account will 
be subject to the monthly maintenance fee unless the $100 
minimum daily balance is maintained. 

b) TD 60+ Checking: TD 60+ Checking accounts eligible for 
Customers who are 60 years of age or older. 

Trust Accounts 
a) Unwritten: If your Account is designated as a trust Account, 

in the absence of any written trust agreement provided to 
us at Account opening, this Account is deemed a Revocable 
Unwritten Trust, and you as trustee may withdraw all of the 
funds during your lifetime. In the event of your death, the 
Account will belong to the person you named as Account 
beneficiary, if that person is still living. That Account 
beneficiary would have the sole right to withdraw the funds 
in the Account at anytime after your death (although the Bank 
may be entitled under applicable law to place a hold on the 
funds before payment to the beneficiary), but not before. 

b) Written: If you have opened the Account as trustee of 
a written trust or as trustee pursuant to court order, only 

the trustee will be allowed to withdraw funds or otherwise 
transact business on the Account as designated by the trust 
instrument or court order. We can request a certified copy 
of any trust instrument or court order, but whether or not a 
copy is filed with us, we will not be held responsible or liable 
to any of the written trust’s beneficiaries for the trustee’s 
actions. Beneficiaries acquire the right to withdraw only as 
provided in the trust instrument or court order. 

The person(s) creating either of these Trust Account types 
may make changes to the Account, including changes to the 
beneficiaries or the Account type, and may withdraw funds on 
deposit in the Account, only as permitted by the trust instrument 
or court order. 

Some jurisdictions have specific laws governing other specific 
types of fiduciary Accounts. If you establish one of these types 
of Accounts, you agree to comply with all of the laws applicable 
to such types of Accounts. 

With all fiduciary and custody Accounts, regardless of whether 
a written trust instrument has been provided to us, the owners 
and beneficiaries of the Account agree that we will not be 
liable if the trustee or custodian commits a breach of trust or 
breach of fiduciary duty, or fails to comply with the terms of 
a written trust agreement or comply with applicable law. We 
are not responsible for enforcing the terms of any written trust 
agreement or applicable law against the trustee or custodian, 
and can rely on the genuineness of any document delivered 
to us, and the truthfulness of any statement made to us, by a 
trustee or custodian. 

Uniform Gifts/Transfers To Minors Act Account 
If your Account is opened under the Uniform Transfers to Minors 
Act or Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, the funds in the Account 
belong to the minor [depending on the jurisdiction in which you 
have opened such an Account and the circumstances, a minor 
may be a child under the age of eighteen (18) or under the age 
of twenty-one (21)] you have named. You must provide to us 
the minor’s Social Security Number. You, as custodian, or the 
custodian you have named, may withdraw all of the funds in the 
Account at any time for the benefit of the minor you have named. 
Our contractual obligation to honor checks, orders, withdrawals 
or other requests related to the Account is with the custodian 
only. In the event of the custodian’s death, the person named as 
successor custodian (as provided by law) will succeed to these 
rights. When the minor reaches the age of majority applicable in 
his or her jurisdiction, or at another time determined by applicable 
law, the custodian shall transfer any funds remaining in the 
Account to the minor or to the minor’s estate. 

Power of Attorney 
We may, in our sole discretion (unless we are required by law to

recognize a statutory form of power of attorney), recognize the 
authority of a person to whom you have given a power of attorney 
to enter into transactions relating to your Account, until and 
unless we receive written notice or we have actual notice of the 
revocation of such power of attorney. However, you must show 
us an original copy or certified copy of the power of attorney, 
properly notarized, and any other documentation we may ask for 
from time to time. The power of attorney and all other documents 
must be in a form satisfactory to the Bank. We will not be liable 
for damages or penalty by reason of any payment made to, or at 
the direction of, a person holding a power of attorney. 

Certified Taxpayer Identification Number (“TIN”) or Social 
Security Number (“SSN”) 
Federal law requires you to provide to the Bank a valid and 
certified Taxpayer Identification Number (“TIN”) or Social Security 
Number (“SSN”). We may be required by federal or state law to 
withhold a portion of the interest credited to your Account in 
the following circumstances: 

a) you do not give us a correct TIN or SSN;

b) the IRS tells us that you gave us an incorrect TIN or SSN;

c) the IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding
because you have under-reported your interest or other
income;

d) you fail to certify to us that you are not subject to backup
withholding;

e) you do not certify your TIN or SSN to us; or

f) there may be other reasons why we may be required to do
so under applicable law.

If we do this, the amount we withhold will be reported to you 
and the IRS and applied by the IRS to the payment of any Federal 
income tax you may owe for that year. 

Credit Verification and Obtaining 
Financial Information 
You agree that we may verify credit and employment 
history through third parties, including but not limited 
to consumer reporting agencies, or verify any previous 
banking relationships of yours for any Accounts you 
have with the Bank now or in the future. If an Account is 
declined based on adverse information, you may request from the 
consumer reporting agency a copy of the information supplied 
to us. Additionally, if your Account is closed for insufficient funds 
activity or other negative reason, a report may be made by us to 
one or more consumer reporting agencies or other third parties 
if permitted by applicable law. Please notify us if you have a 
dispute or if you have questions regarding the information we 
provide. Write to us at: TD Bank Overdraft Collections, Mailstop 
ME02-002-036, P.O. Box 9547, Portland, ME 04112. Please 
provide your name, Account number, and why you believe there 

is an inaccuracy or describe the item you are not sure about. We 
will complete any investigation and notify you of our findings 
and, if necessary, corrections. Please note that calling us will not 
preserve your rights. 

If you are a licensed attorney, you agree that we may report 
information about overdrafts on and/or returned checks drawn 
on Accounts which you maintain as trustee for the benefit of 
another person or in any fiduciary capacity, to the extent and in 
the manner required by applicable laws, rules, or regulations. You 
agree that we have no liability to you for reporting any information 
to applicable authorities regarding any Account which we believe 
in good faith is subject to such laws, rules, or regulations. 

If you’re having trouble with payments, lenders want to explore 
options with you. Visit td.com or reach out to the National 
Foundation for Credit Counseling online or by phone at 
1-877-357-6322 for help.

Conflicting Demands/Disputes 
If there is any uncertainty or conflicting demand regarding 
the ownership of an account or its funds; or we are unable to 
determine any person’s authority to give us instructions; or we 
are requested by law enforcement or a state or local agency to 
freeze the account or reject a transaction due to the suspected 
financial abuse of an elder or dependent adult; or we believe a 
transaction may be fraudulent or may violate any law, we may, 
in our sole discretion: 

1) freeze the account and refuse transactions until we receive
written proof (in form and substance satisfactory to us) of each 
person’s right and authority over the account and its funds;

2) close the account and distribute the account balance, subject 
to any debts or obligations owed to the Bank, equally to each 
accountholder;

3) refuse transactions and return checks, marked “Refer to
Maker” (or similar language);

4) require the signatures of all authorized signers for the
withdrawal of funds, the closing of an account, or any change 
in the account regardless of the number of authorized signers 
on the account;

5) request instructions from a court of competent jurisdiction at 
your expense regarding the account or transaction; and/or

6) continue to honor checks and other instructions given to us
by persons who appear as authorized signers according to
our records. The existence of the rights set forth above shall
not impose an obligation on us to assert such rights or to
deny a transaction.

If any person notifies us of a dispute, we do not have to decide if 
the dispute has merit before we take further action. We may take 
these actions without any liability and without advance notice, 
unless the law says otherwise

Changing Your Account 
If we agree to let you make any change to your Account type in 
the middle of the Account’s interest and/or service charge cycle, 
without requiring you to open a new Account and without 
changing your Account number, you agree that the following 
rules will apply to the period in which we allow you to make 
this change: 

a) Interest: The rules for the payment of interest (if any) on the 
new Account will take effect on the day the type of Account 
is changed (the “Change Date”). For the days before the
Change Date, the rules for the payment of interest (if any)
and for any minimum balance that must be maintained in
order to qualify for interest (if any) that applied to the old
Account will apply.

b) Fees and Charges: The rules for all fees and charges that
we may charge in connection with the new Account, and
for any minimum balance that must be maintained in order
to avoid certain fees and charges, will take effect after the
Change Date.

c) Account Statement: If you receive statements, the Account 
statement you will receive for the statement period that
includes the Change Date will show: (1) the total interest
earned or accrued during the entire statement period; (2) the 
corresponding “annual percentage yield earned” for the entire 
statement period; and (3) the fees and charges subtracted
from your Account during the entire statement period.

Adverse Claims; Interpleader; Legal Process 
We need not honor any claim against or involving an Account 
unless we are required to do so by order of a court or government 
agency that has jurisdiction over us, or pursuant to applicable 
law. This rule applies to any person asserting any rights or interest 
regarding an Account, including you and other persons who are 
authorized to make withdrawals or write checks or who present 
a power of attorney signed by you. 

If we receive notice of any claim or dispute or of any legal 
proceeding we reasonably believe involves you or any of your 
Accounts, in our discretion we may suspend transactions on any 
Account which we believe to be affected until final determination 
of the claim or proceeding. We may place a hold on any funds 
in the Account and suspend transactions whether the affected 
Account is in your name alone or is a joint Account. An Account 
may be suspended even though the suspension may have been 
due to inadvertence, error because of similarity of the names of 
depositors, or other mistake. 

You agree that we may comply with any state or federal legal 
process, including, without limitation, any writ of attachment, 
adverse claim, execution, garnishment, tax levy, restraining order, 
subpoena or warrant relating to you or your Account which we 

believe to be valid, without any liability from us to you. You agree 
that if we are served with legal process at any of our Stores or 
offices, we may comply with it, even if it is served at a location 
other than where your Account was opened. Further, you agree 
that we may comply with such process as we deem appropriate 
under the circumstances even if the legal process or document 
appears to affect the interest of only one owner of a joint 
Account. In such case, we may refuse to permit withdrawals or 
transfers from your Account until such legal process is satisfied 
or dismissed even if such action results in insufficient funds to 
pay a check you have written or otherwise satisfy an obligation 
you may have incurred. 

You agree that we are entitled to a processing fee, for which you 
are liable to us, upon receipt of any legal process. We may deduct 
such fee, as well as any expenses, including without limitation 
attorneys’ fees, in connection with any such document or legal 
process, from your Account or any other Account you may have 
with us without prior notice to you, or we may bill you directly 
for such expenses and fees. Any garnishment, attachment or 
other levy against your Account shall be subject to our right of 
set-off and security interest. 

You agree that we will not pay and you shall not be entitled to 
receive interest on any funds we hold or set aside in connection 
with or in response to legal process. Finally, you agree that we may 
accept and comply with legal process, irrespective of how and/ 
or where it was received even if the law requires any particular 
method of service. 

You agree to indemnify us against all losses, costs, attorneys’ fees, 
and any other liabilities that we incur by reason of responding to 
or initiating any legal action, including any interpleader action 
we commence involving you or your Account. As part of that 
indemnity, in the event we incur liability to a creditor of yours as 
a result of our response or failure to respond to a legal action, 
you agree to pay us on demand the amount of our liability to 
your creditor and to reimburse us for any expense, attorneys’ fees, 
or other costs we may incur in collecting the amount from you. 

We may, in our sole discretion and without any liability to you, 
initiate an action in interpleader to determine the rights of the 
persons making adverse claims to your Account. We may exercise 
the right regardless of whether the persons making the adverse 
claims have complied with all statutory requirements pertaining 
to adverse claims, such as posting a bond or giving other surety. 
Upon initiation of an interpleader action, we will be relieved and 
discharged of all further duties and obligations. 

If You Owe Us Money 
If you withdraw funds from your Account that you do not have 
a right to withdraw, including the amount of a check or other 
item which we later charge back to your Account or any amounts 
that may be credited to your Account in error, you will have to 

20 21 



 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

pay us back. If you do not, the Bank may apply the funds in or 
deposits to your Account (or any other related account) against 
the debt or obligation owed to us, without providing notice to 
you, except that this provision does not apply to any consumer 
credit covered by the federal Truth in Lending law. In the event 
that your Account is a joint account, the Bank may access the 
funds in your Account to satisfy a debt or obligation owed by 
any of the accountholders to the Bank. 

If there are not enough funds in your Account to cover the debts 
or obligations owed to the Bank, we may overdraw your Account, 
without being liable to you. Some government payments (such 
as Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Veterans and 
other federal or state benefit) may be protected from attachment, 
levy, garnishment, or other legal process under federal or state 
law.  If such protections would otherwise apply to the funds in or 
deposits to your Account, you waive these protections and agree 
that we may use these funds or deposits to satisfy debts owed 
to the Bank. The Bank also may bring a lawsuit against you to 
get the money back. We can also do this if you owe us any fees 
or charges in connection with your Account and you do not pay 
us. If we bring a lawsuit against you, you agree to pay our court 
costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees as awarded by the court 
and as permitted by law. 

Right of Set-Off 
Unless we are prohibited by applicable law, the Bank can take 
any funds in any of your Account(s) to pay any debt you owe 
us or liability. This is called the right of set-off and applies to all 
funds of yours in our possession now or in the future. We can 
use this right of set-off without giving you any notice (unless 
notice is required by applicable law) and without going through 
any legal processes or court proceedings. If this is a joint Account, 
the right of set-off applies to deposits of each co-owner to pay 
the debts owed to us by any or all of you. Likewise, we could 
withdraw money from an Account owned by only one person 
and apply it to reduce the joint debt of that person and another 
person. This right of set-off does not apply to your Account if: (a) 
it is an IRA or a tax-deferred retirement Account, Health Savings 
Account, or Coverdell Education Savings Account; or (b) the 
debt is created by a consumer credit transaction under a credit 
card plan; or (c) the debtor’s right of withdrawal arises only in a 
representative capacity. 

We also have a right to place a hold on funds in your Account(s) 
if we have a claim against you or pending exercise of our right of 
set-off. If we place a hold on your Account, you may not withdraw 
funds from the Account and we can refuse to pay checks or other 
items drawn on the Account. 

In addition to any right of set-off, you hereby grant to the Bank 
a security interest in your deposit Accounts to secure all loans or 
other extensions of credit, now or in the future. 

Death/Incompetence 
Your death, or a declaration that you are legally incompetent to 
handle your affairs, does not end our authority to pay checks 
signed or other items authorized by you, to accept deposits or 
to collect items deposited until we receive written notice of your 
death or declared incompetence. Even after we receive notice, 
we can pay checks or other items authorized by you before your 
death or declared incompetence for such period of time permitted 
under applicable law. 

On joint Accounts, your death or declared incompetence does 
not affect the rights of any other owner of the Account to make 
deposits, make withdrawals or, if applicable, write checks. We 
may require the surviving owners and any in-trust-for Account 
beneficiary to provide reasonable proof of your death or 
incompetence and, in some jurisdictions, provide any tax releases 
or other documents or consents needed from government 
authorities before we pay any checks or other items authorized 
on your joint Account or allow the surviving owners or your 
beneficiary to withdraw any funds from the Account. Each of 
you is responsible for notifying us when any other joint owner 
of an Account dies. 

Certain checks or other items made payable to a deceased joint 
Account holder (e.g. Social Security checks or electronic deposits) 
must be returned to the issuer and may not be used, cashed or 
disposed of in any other way by the surviving Account holders. 
If such items are used, cashed or disposed of by any one or all 
of the surviving Account holders, each Account holder remains 
liable for the amount of the item and any charges incurred as a 
result of the improper use of the item. In our discretion, we can 
charge your Account for the amount of these items and remit 
payment to the issuer of the item.

FUNDS TRANSFERS DISCLOSURE, THE BANK’S LIABILITY IS

EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS, WHETHER OR NOT IT

This Agreement and the deposit relationship do not create a 
fiduciary, quasi-fiduciary, or special relationship between you 
and us. Our deposit relationship with you is that of debtor and 
creditor. For IRA Accounts, you acknowledge that the Bank does 
not provide fiduciary advice with respect to your IRA Account, 
including, but not limited to advice regarding a contribution into 
a specific IRA account, a distribution from a retirement account, 
or a rollover from a retirement plan into an IRA deposit account. 
You agree that you will neither solicit nor rely upon the Bank or 
any of its employees for any such advice. 

The Bank’s internal policies and procedures are solely for our own 
purposes and do not impose on us a higher standard of care than 
otherwise would apply by law without such policies or procedures. 

Default 
Your Account may be in default if: (a) you have repeatedly 
overdrawn your Account; (b) you do not repay immediately any 
overdraft; (c) you do not comply fully with any term or condition 
of this Agreement or of any other agreement you may have with 
us; (d) you give us false or misleading information about yourself 
or any of your deposit or credit relationships with us or with 
others; (e) you file or someone else files against you a petition in 
bankruptcy; (f) any of your loans with us is past due or otherwise 
in default; (g) we, in our sole discretion, are not satisfied with 
your condition or affairs, financial or otherwise; or (h) we, in our 
sole discretion, believe that your financial condition has suffered 
an adverse change. 

If you are in default, we may close any or all of your Accounts, 
with or without notice (unless notice is required under applicable 
law), or we may exercise all available rights and remedies provided 
elsewhere in this Agreement or other agreements and all rights 
and remedies available at law or equity. 

Indemnity 
a) In General. You agree to indemnify, and hold TD Bank 

harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, 
penalties, damages, costs, expenses (including, but not limited 
to, attorneys’ fees and court costs) or other harm or injury 
that we may incur as a result of any claim asserted against us 
by any third party arising out of any action at any time taken 
or omitted to be taken by (i) you under or in connection with 
this Agreement, including, but not limited to, your failure to 
observe and perform properly each and every obligation in 

accordance with this Agreement and any other agreement 
which you enter into with us; or (ii) us in reliance upon any 
certification, evidence of authority, or other document or 
notice given or purporting to have been given by you to us, 
or any information or order which you provide to us. This 
indemnification does not apply to claims that you may assert 
against us, or to any amounts we are obligated to pay you 
under the terms of this Agreement or applicable law. 

b) Your Instructions to Us. Without limiting the above, if 
you give us instructions which we believe may expose us to 
potential liability, we may refuse to follow your instructions. 
If we decide to follow your instructions, you agree to 
indemnify us against all losses, costs, attorneys’ fees and 
any other liabilities we incur. In addition, we may ask you for 
certain protections, such as a surety bond or your indemnity 
in a form satisfactory to us. 

Jury Trial Waiver 
YOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT NEITHER YOU NOR WE 
SHALL (A) SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, 
COUNTERCLAIM, OR ANY OTHER ACTION BASED UPON, OR 
ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ACCOUNT OR THE 
DEALINGS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU OR US, OR (B) 
SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY 
TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. THE PROVISIONS 
OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO NO EXCEPTIONS. 
NEITHER YOU NOR WE HAVE AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED 
TO THE OTHER THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL 
NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES. YOU AND WE EACH 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER HAS BEEN KNOWINGLY 
AND VOLUNTARILY MADE. 

Demand Deposit Accounts and Sub-Accounts 
All Checking Accounts consist of two separate sub-Accounts: 
a transaction sub-Account, and a non-transaction sub-Account. 
Whenever your transaction sub-Account balance exceeds a certain 
level (which we may set and change at our discretion without 
notice to you), funds above that level may be transferred from 
the transaction sub-Account to the non-transaction sub-Account 
at the Bank’s discretion, as often as once each day. All of your 
Checking Account transactions are posted to the transaction 
sub-Account. Balances transferred to the non-transaction sub-
Account are transferred back to the transaction sub-Account to 
meet these transactional needs, so there is no adverse impact on 
the availability of the balances held in your Checking Account. In 
accordance with federal limitations, no more than six (6) transfers 
from the non-transaction sub-Account can occur during any 
statement cycle. Therefore, if a sixth (6th) transfer is needed, we 
will return all balances to the transaction sub-Account for the 
remainder of the statement cycle.

These sub-Accounts are treated as a single Checking Account for 
purposes of deposits and withdrawals, access and information, 
statement reporting, and any fees or charges. There are no 
separate or additional balance requirements, fees, or charges 
associated with the creation of these sub-Accounts. If your 
Checking Account is a non-interest bearing Account, neither the 
transaction sub-Account nor the non-transaction sub-Account 
receives any interest. If your Checking Account is an interest-
bearing Checking Account, both the transaction sub-Account 
and the non-transaction sub-Account receive the same interest 
rate at all times, and your periodic statement will reflect a single 
blended Annual Percentage Yield (“APY”) and APY Earned. 

In accordance with federal regulations, we reserve the right to 
require seven (7) Calendar Days advance notice of withdrawals 
from interest-bearing transaction sub-Accounts and all non-
transaction sub-Accounts. While the Bank is required to reserve 
this right, the Bank does not presently exercise this right. 

Miscellaneous 
a) Our Right to Refuse/Close Accounts: The Bank reserves 

the right to refuse to open any Account and to terminate any 
Account at any time, and for any reason, or no reason without 
notice to you (unless notice is required under applicable law). 
This Agreement survives the closing of your Account. 

b) Our Right to Delay Enforcement: We can choose to not 
enforce or delay in enforcing any provisions of this Agreement 
without losing the right to enforce them in the future. 

c) Assignment: Your Account may not be transferred, pledged 
or assigned without the Bank’s prior written consent, to be 
given or refused at the Bank’s sole discretion. 

d) Items in the Mail: We are not responsible for any items you 
mail to us that are lost in transit. Therefore, you may not wish 
to place currency or coupons in the mail. 

e) Direct Deposit: If you have direct deposit, you agree that if a 
direct deposit must be returned for any reason, you authorize 
us to deduct the amount from this Account or any other 
Account you may have with us, without prior notice and at 
any time. 

f) Accounts with Zero Balance: 
i) Your Account may not be considered closed if you 

transfer all of the funds out of your Account or reduce 
the Account balance to zero. We may continue to assess 
fees to your Account; please refer to the Personal Fee 
Schedule and Personal Account Maintenance Information 
grid for any applicable fees. 

ii) Accounts can only be closed by you if the current balance is 
at zero. If you would like to close your Account, you must 
contact us directly by visiting one of our Stores, contacting

signed and notarized.  Written requests must be sent to: 
TD Bank, NA

Lewiston, ME 04243-1377 

iii) You should not close your account until all the transactions 
you arranged for have been paid, and you should leave 
enough funds to pay them and any fees. You will owe 
us for any fees or transactions that are pending during 
the Account closure process or that post to your Account 
before we close the Account.  Your account will not be 
closed until we process your request. 

Please check your account following your request date to 
ensure the Account has been closed. 

iv) We may consider any Account (excluding CDs) that has a 
zero balance for forty-five (45) Calendar Days to be closed. 

v) This section does not change our ability to close Your 
Account(s) at any time within our discretion for any reason 
or no reason at all. 

g) Notice of Address Changes: You must notify us in writing, 
by phone or at any of our banking offices, of any change 
of address. Any communication we send to you at the last 
address as shown on our records will be binding on you for 
all purposes. You agree we may change your address on our 
records based on information provided by the United States 
Postal Service without notice to you. 

h) Abandoned Accounts: If your Account is considered to be 
abandoned under applicable law because you have not used 
or acknowledged your Account for a time period directed 
by law, we must turn over the funds in your Account to the 
appropriate governmental authority. We may give notices as 
required by law before we do this. You may try to reclaim 
funds turned over to the governmental authority to the extent 
permitted by applicable law. 

i) Account Mailings: From time to time, the Bank may enclose 
advertising or promotional materials with any periodic 
statement that is mailed or otherwise made available to you 
with respect to your Account(s). These materials may include, 
without limitation, information regarding new, modified or 
discontinued products or services, as well as sweepstakes 
or other contests sponsored by the Bank. By opening and 
maintaining an Account with the Bank, you consent to the 
mailing and receipt of these advertising or promotional 
materials with your periodic statement. 

j) Banking Practices: In the absence of a specific provision in 
this Agreement to the contrary, your Account will be subject to 
our usual banking practices and, to the extent not inconsistent 
therewith, the general commercial banking practices in the 
area we serve.

k) Severability: If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, 
changed by applicable law or declared invalid by order of 
a court, the remaining terms of this Agreement will not be 
affected, and the invalid provision shall be reformed in order 
to preserve the original intent of this Agreement to the fullest 
extent feasible. However, if such reformation is not feasible, 
this Agreement will be interpreted as if the invalid provision 
had not been placed in this Agreement. 

l) Governing Law: This Agreement and any claim, controversy 
or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement shall 
be governed by and interpreted in accordance with federal 
law and, to the extent not preempted or inconsistent 
therewith if you opened your Account in person in a Store 
(or branch) by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Store 
(or branch) where you opened your Account is located, or if 
you are a government or other public entity, by the laws of 
the jurisdiction pursuant to which you were incorporated or 
otherwise organized. If you opened your Account online or 
by telephone then this Agreement and any claim, controversy 
or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement shall be

notify you of the changes by posting a new version of this 
Agreement online, or by making the new version available in

will be considered open when you sign a signature card

complete and sign any other Account documentation that we 
may require from time to time to maintain your Account.

i) Paper Statement Fee: We may impose a fee, as disclosed 
on the Personal Fee Schedule, for certain Account types 
that choose to receive paper statements. 

The Paper Statement Fee is charged per Account, not per 
statement; therefore a combined statement with more than 
one Account could receive multiple fees. 

d) Interest Rate and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE YIELD: 
The current interest rate on your Account and the 
Annual Percentage Yield (or “APY”) are as shown on the 
accompanying Deposit Rate Sheet, which is considered part 
of this disclosure. 

Note: If this disclosure was given to you in connection with an 
inquiry, the Interest Rate(s) and APY(s) shown are accurate as of 
the date shown on our Deposit Rate Sheet. Current rates may be 
obtained by calling Customer Service at the toll-free number listed 
on the back of this disclosure or visiting our website. 

TD Convenience Checking, TD Simple Checking and Savings 
Transaction Accounts: These are non-interest bearing Accounts 
and have no APY. 

All interest bearing Checking, Savings, and Money Market 
Accounts: The interest rate and APY may change daily and are 
adjusted periodically by the Bank based on various economic 
factors. There is no limit on changes up or down and the rates are 
subject to change at any time without notice. 

i) TD Step Rate CDs: Three (3) and five (5) year terms 

are available. The APY will increase every year on the 

anniversary of the Account open date. At maturity, the 

TD Step Rate CD will renew to a one (1) year term. 

ii) All other CDs: The interest rate and APY are fixed for the 

term of the certificate and may only be changed at maturity. 

iii) To Obtain the Annual Percentage Yield (“APY”) 

Disclosed: For Checking, Savings, and Money Market 

Accounts, you must maintain the minimum tier balance 

in the Account each day in order to obtain the disclosed 

APY for that particular tier. For CDs, the initial Interest 

Rate is determined by the balance at account opening. 

Interest Rates for subsequent terms is determined by 

the CD balance at the end of the grace period. The APY 

disclosed assumes the Account remains on deposit for one 

year at the same interest rate. 

iv) Balance Computation Method: We use the daily balance 

method to calculate interest on your Account. This method 

applies a periodic rate to the principal in the Account 

each day. 

v) Accrual of Interest: For all deposit Accounts (except CDs), 

interest begins to accrue no later than the Business Day we 

receive credit for the deposit of non-cash items (for 

example, checks). For Savings and Money Market Accounts, 

interest is accrued each day on the full collected balance. The 

collected balance is the available balance in your Account 

as determined by our Funds Availability policy. 

vi) Frequency of Compounding and Crediting of Interest 

(Applicable to All Interest Bearing Accounts): The 

Bank compounds interest monthly. Interest is credited on 

a monthly basis. If you or we close your interest bearing 

Account before the date of interest posting, accrued 

interest in the amount of $10 or more will be paid. Accrued 

interest in an amount under $10 will not be paid except 

at the discretion of the Bank. 

e)  Checking Balance Tier Structures 

i) TD Beyond Checking: The chart which follows indicates 

the balance tier levels used to determine the variable 

interest rate and annual percentage yield (APY) being 

applied to your Account. The interest rate and APY for 

the appropriate tier will be paid on the full balance in 

the Account. 
Balance Tier Structure: 
$ 0.01 – $ 999.99 $ 50,000.00 – $ 99,999.99 
$ 1,000.00 – $ 9,999.99 $100,000.00 – $249,999.99 
$10,000.00 – $24,999.99 $250,000.00 – $499,999.99 
$25,000.00 – $49,999.99 $500,000.00 – $999,999.99 

$1,000,000.00+ 

ii) TD Private Tiered Checking Account: The chart below 

indicates the balance tier levels used to determine the 

variable interest rate and APY being applied to your 

Account. The interest rate and annual percentage yield 

for the appropriate tier will be paid on the full balance in 

the Account.

$500,000.00+ 

f)  Checking Account Information 

i) TD Beyond Checking 

1) Account Information: The monthly maintenance fee 

for TD Beyond Checking Accounts will be waived in 

each service charge cycle (a monthly period based on 

your statement date) that the Account meets at least 

one of the qualifications specified below.: 

a) Your TD Beyond Checking account has direct deposits 

of at least $5,000 or more 

30 31 



  

  

  
 
 
 
 
 
 

  
 
 

 

 
       

 

  
  
  
 
 
 

  

 
 
 
 

 

  
          

 
  
 

  
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 
 
 

b) You maintain a minimum daily balance of $2,500 in 
your TD Beyond Checking account 

c) You maintain a $25,000 minimum daily combined 
deposit, outstanding loan and/or mortgage balance 
(excluding credit card) relationship in Accounts you 
choose to link as specified in the Personal Account 
Maintenance Information Grid. 

TD Beyond Checking Accounts are eligible for 
monthly maintenance fee waivers on one additional 
TD Simple Checking Account and all personal Savings 
Accounts (including Money Market and Health Savings 
Accounts) that you choose to link to your TD Beyond 
Checking Account. You must request these waivers; 
they are not automatically applied.  Waivers expire 
when the TD Beyond Checking Account is closed. 

Linked Accounts that are not eligible for monthly 
maintenance fee waivers will need to meet the balance 
requirements to avoid the monthly maintenance fee on 
those Accounts. 

2) Combined Balances: You can designate your TD 
Beyond Checking Account as your primary Checking 
Account and then link certain other Accounts to it 
for Relationship Pricing. With Relationship Pricing, 
balances in those Accounts are included in your daily 
combined balance which is used to determine if the 
monthly maintenance fee on your TD Beyond Checking 
Account is waived. 

You must tell us what other Accounts you want us to link to 
your TD Beyond Checking Account for relationship Pricing. 
We do not link your Accounts unless you tell us to do so. 
The Personal Account Maintenance Grid lists the required 
daily combined balance for a TD Beyond Checking Account 
and the types of Accounts that can be linked for relationship 
Pricing. Restrictions apply. 

Once you have selected which Accounts to be included 
in the combined balance, we will look at the end-of-
Business-Day-balance of each selected Account and add 
them together to get the total combined daily balance. If 
your end-of-Business-Day-balance in one of the selected 
Accounts is negative, it will have a negative effect on the 
total combined daily balance requirement. 

When an existing Account is closed and a new Account 
is opened to replace the existing Account, we do not 
automatically link the new Account to your TD Beyond 
Checking Account, even if the existing Account was linked. 
You must tell us to link the new Account for Relationship 
Pricing. 

ii) TD Private Tiered Checking: TD Private Tiered Checking 
Accounts are eligible for monthly maintenance fee waivers 
on one additional personal Checking Account and all 
personal Savings Accounts that you choose to include in 
a combined statement with your Private Tiered Checking 
Account. You may also request waivers for any TD Health 
Savings Account(s) you own. You must request these 
waivers; they are not automatically applied. Waivers expire 
when the Private Tiered Checking Account is closed. 

g) Savings Balance Tier Structures 

i) TD Beyond Savings and TD Private Tiered Savings:  
The chart which follows indicates the balance tier levels 
used to determine the variable interest rate and APY being

4) Whether or not you made at least one qualifying
transfer into your TD Growth Money Market Account
during your current statement cycle.

• A qualifying transfer is a recurring transfer of any
amount from a TD Bank Account. Eligible transfers 
include recurring transfers set up by phone or at a
TD Bank Store, or through Online Banking. Transfers 
set up using ATMs, voice response units, overdraft
protection transfers, and sweeps are not eligible.

• In addition, an immediate transfer completed
through Online Banking will also qualify.

• To be eligible, your qualifying transfer must post
during the period starting the first Business Day
and ending the last Business Day of your current
statement cycle. Please be aware of the available
balance in your Accounts - transferring funds from
an Account with an insufficient balance may result
in an Overdraft and a fee may be charged.  Please
refer to the Overdraft section for details.

On the last Business Day of your statement cycle,
we will determine whether you meet the above
requirements, and the interest rate and APY applied 
to your Account from the first Business Day of the
next statement cycle will be adjusted, if necessary,
to reflect your Account qualification status.

For the current interest rate on your Account, please 
refer to the appropriate table on the accompanying

i) Special Information for Certificates of Deposit:

i) TD Choice and Private CDs: The chart which follows
indicates the balance tier levels used to determine the
interest rate and APY being applied to your Certificate
of Deposit. The balance tier level for your Certificate of
Deposit is determined by the opening balance of your CD 
and will not vary throughout the term of your deposit.
After maturity and if your CD auto-renews, the balance
tier level for your Certificate of Deposit for subsequent
renewed terms will be determined by the balance at the
end of your Grace Period.

Balance Tier Structure: 
$250.00 – $9,999.99 $50,000 – $99,999.99 
$10,000 – $49,999.99 $100,000+ 

ii) Certificates of Deposit Information

TD Choice CDs For personal and certain personal trust
TD Choice CDs, the interest rate and APY applied will also 
be determined by whether or not we have on record an
eligible TD Bank Personal Checking Account at the time
that the CD is opened or matures.

If you have an eligible TD Bank Personal Checking Account 
on the date that you open your TD Choice CD, your 
TD Choice CD will earn the Relationship rate and APY. 
For the current interest rate on your Account, please refer 
to the appropriate column on the accompanying Deposit 
Rate Sheet for your initial term. For subsequent terms, 
Relationship status will be determined on the business day 
prior to the maturity of your TD Choice CD. 

iii) Early Withdrawal Penalties: No part of the principal
may be withdrawn prior to maturity without the Bank’s
consent. No withdrawals will be permitted during the
first seven (7) days of the CD term. If the Bank does
allow an early withdrawal, the following penalties will be
calculated and charged based on your current balance
and interest rate:

CD Term Penalty 

7 – 89 days All interest 

90 days < 1 year 3 months’ interest 

1 year < 2 years 6 months’ interest 

2 years < 3 years 9 months’ interest 

3 years < 4 years 12 months’ interest 

4 years < 5 years 18 months’ interest 

5 years + 24 months’ interest 

In certain circumstances, such as the death or incompetence 
of an owner of the CD, the penalty may be waived. In 
no circumstances can the amount withdrawn bring the 
balance to below the Minimum to Open, as disclosed in 
the accompanying Personal Account Maintenance 
Information grid. 

TD Step Rate CD: Partial and full withdrawals may be made 
without penalty during a ten (10) day grace period that 
begins on each anniversary of the Account opening date. 

TD No-Catch CD: At no cost to you, you will have the 
option to withdraw principal funds without penalty once 
during the term of the CD. Therefore, if you choose to 
withdraw principal funds, there will be no penalty for that

withdrawal. More than one withdrawal of principal during 
the term of this CD may result in a penalty. The interest rate 
and APY remain the same for the term. No withdrawals 
will be permitted during the first seven (7) days of the 
CD term. 

iv) Withdrawal of Interest Prior To Maturity: The APY 
disclosed assumes interest and principal will remain on 
deposit until maturity. A withdrawal will reduce earnings. 
For CDs of less than one (1) year, the APY assumes the CD 
remains on deposit for one (1) year at the current rate. 

v) Renewal Policies: Unless otherwise noted, CDs will 
automatically renew to the same term at maturity. At 
maturity, the TD Step Rate CD will renew to a one (1) 
year CD.At maturity you will have ten (10) Calendar Days 
beginning on the maturity date to withdraw the funds 
without penalty or make additional deposits. Interest not 
withdrawn will be converted to principal upon the renewal 
of the certificate. 

For TD Choice CDs, you must have an eligible TD Bank 
Personal Checking account as of the business day prior 
to your maturity date in order to earn the Relationship 
interest rate on your next term. TD Choice CDs that do 
not have an eligible personal TD Checking Account as of 
the business day prior to your maturity date will earn the 
Standard interest rate. 

vi) Interest Computation: Interest is accrued on all deposits 
as of the day the Account is opened on a 365/365-day 
basis (366/366-day basis during a leap year), and is 
compounded monthly on the cycle date. The APY for 
the Account assumes that interest will remain on deposit 
until maturity; a withdrawal will reduce earnings. The 
daily balance method is used to calculate the interest on 
the Account. This method applies a daily periodic rate to 
the principal in the Account each day. Interest is credited 
monthly for all CDs. 

vii) Additional Deposits: We do not accept additional 
deposits on TD Choice, Private, TD No-Catch or 
TD Step Rate CDs. Additional deposits on discontinued CD 
Account types, if permitted, are governed by your original 
certificate. For TD IRA Add-Vantage CDs, you may  make 
additional deposits of not less than $500 per deposit at 
any time during the term up to a maximum of $250,000 
in additional deposits. 

viii) Promotional CD Interest Rates: We may offer 
Promotional CD interest rates which may have different 
Account opening requirements than our non-promotional 
TD Choice CD terms. These requirements will be disclosed 
on the Deposit Rate Sheet. If we are offering such a 
promotion and you are opening a new Account, you must 

deposit the required initial minimum balance to open the 
Account in money not already on deposit at TD Bank to 
qualify. If we are offering such a promotion and you have 
a renewing CD, you may be eligible for the promotional 
rate by making a deposit of new to bank money to the 
renewing CD that is equal to or greater than the new 
Account minimum balance requirement. Maximum deposit 
limits may apply. Promotional CDs will automatically renew 
at maturity to the same term at the non-promotional 
TD Choice CD interest rate and APY in effect at the time 
of renewal unless we notify you otherwise. Promotional 
CD interest rates and/or Special Offers apply only until the 
promotional CD’s first maturity date. 

ix) Grand Opening Bonus CD Rate: In addition to the terms 
above, a TD Bank personal Checking Account is required. 
The offer is valid for new CD Accounts only and does not 
include IRA CDs. 

Part III: Funds Availability Policy 
Your ability to withdraw funds you have deposited at the Bank 
will be determined according to this policy. 

This disclosure applies to all transaction Accounts such as 
Checking and Interest Bearing Checking Accounts, and to Money 
Market, Savings, and Time/Certificate of Deposit Accounts. 

The Bank’s general policy is to make funds from your 
deposits available to you no later than the first (1st) 
Business Day after the day we receive your deposit. 
Electronic direct deposits, TCH RTP transfers, and wire transfers 
will be available on the day we receive the deposit. Once they 
are available, you can withdraw the funds in cash and we will 
use the funds to pay checks that you have written. 

Determining the Availability of a Deposit 
a) Timing: To determine the availability of your deposits, every 

day is a Business Day, except Saturdays, Sundays and federal 
holidays. If you make a deposit on a Business Day we are not 
open, we will consider the deposit to be made on the next 
Business Day we are open. 

b) Deposits in TD Bank Stores: If you make a deposit with 
a Store employee before 8:00 p.m. on a Business Day that 
we’re open, we will consider that day to be the day of your 
deposit. However, if you make a deposit after 8:00 p.m. or 
on a day we are not open, we will consider that the deposit 
was made on the next Business Day we are open. 

c) Deposit by Mail: If you mail funds to us, the funds are 
considered deposited on the Business Day we receive them. 

d) Deposits by ATM: If you make a deposit at a Bank ATM 
before 8:00 p.m. on a Business Day that we are open, we 
will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. If you 
make a deposit at a Bank ATM after 8:00 p.m. or on a day

we are not open, we will consider the deposit made on the 
next Business Day we are open. 

e) Deposits by Mobile App: If you make a deposit through
TD Bank Mobile Deposit before 8:00 p.m. on a Business Day 
that we are open, we will consider that day to be the day
of your deposit. However, if you make a deposit through
TD Bank Mobile Deposit after 8:00 p.m. or on a day we are
not open, we will consider the deposit made on the next
Business Day we are open.

f) Deposits by Night Depository or Store Lockbox:
Funds deposited in a night depository or Store lockbox are
considered deposited on the next Business Day the Bank or
Store lockbox is open.

Please note that the Funds Availability may vary depending 
on the type and method of deposit as explained on the 
following two pages: 

Same Day Availability 
Funds from the following deposits are available on the same day 
they are deposited: 

a) Cash deposits;

b) Funds received for deposit by an electronic payment (including 
ACH credits and transfers, including TCH RTP) and wire
transfers;

c) Wire transfers;

d) $100 for non-cash deposits made at the Bank’s teller station; 

e) $100 for non-cash deposits made at the Bank’s ATM.

TD FastFunds 
TD FastFunds is a service which will enable expedited funds 
availability in exchange for a fee. Please see the Personal Fee 
Schedule for applicable fees. Deposits eligible for and subject to 
Fast Funds may be available at the time of deposit and credited 
to your account first before any other items, such as deposits and 
withdrawals made the same day. 

Longer Delays May Apply 
In some cases, we will not make all the funds that you deposit 
by check available at the times shown in this Policy. 

Depending on the type of check you deposit, funds may not be 
available until the second (2nd) Business Day after the day of your 
deposit. The first $200 of your deposit, however, will be available no 
later than the first (1st) Business Day after the day of your deposit. 
If we are not going to make all of the funds from your deposit 
available on the first (1st) Business Day, we will notify you at the 
time you make your deposit. We will also tell you when the funds 
will be available. If your deposit is not made directly to one of our 
employees, or if we decide to take this action after you have left the 
premises, we will mail you the notice by the day after we receive 
your deposit. If you will need the funds from a deposit right away, 
you should ask us when the funds will be available. 

In addition, funds deposited by check may be delayed for a longer 
period under the following circumstances: 

a) You deposit checks totaling more than $5,000 on any one
day (Note: The first $200 will be made available no later than 
the first (1st) Business Day after the day of your deposit);

b) We believe a check you deposited will not be paid;

c) You re-deposit a check that has been returned unpaid;

d) You have overdrawn your Account repeatedly, or would have 
overdrawn your Account if checks had been honored in the
last six (6) months;

e) There is an emergency, such as failure of communications
or computer equipment. (Note: The first $200 will be made
available no later than the first (1st) Business Day after the
day of your deposit).

We will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for 
any of these reasons, and we will tell you when the funds will be 
available. They will generally be available no later than the seventh 
(7th) Business Day after the day of your deposit. 

Special Rules For New Accounts 
If you are a new Customer, the following special rules may apply 
during the first thirty (30) days your Account is open. 

a) Funds from in-Store cash deposits, electronic direct deposits, 
TCH RTP transfers and wire transfers to your Account will be 
available on the day we receive the deposit.

b) The first $100 of your daily in-Store non-cash deposits will
be available to you on the day we receive the deposit.

c) Funds from the first $5,000 of a day’s total deposits of
cashier’s, certified, teller’s, traveler’s, and federal, state, and
local government checks will be available on the first (1st)
Business Day after the day of your deposit.

d) The excess over $5,000 and funds from all other check
deposits will be available no later than the seventh (7th)
Business Day after the day of your deposit.

rule may apply during the first thirty (30) days your Account is 
open. 

a) Cash deposits and first $100 of your daily ATM non - cash
deposits will be available to you on the day we receive the
deposit.

Holds on Other Funds 
If we accept for deposit or we cash a check that is drawn on 
another bank, we may make funds from the deposit available for 
withdrawal immediately, but delay your availability to withdraw 
a corresponding amount of funds that you have on deposit in 
another Account with us. The funds in the other Account would 
then not be available for withdrawal in accordance with the time 
periods that are described in this policy.

Non-U.S. Financial Institutions 
We reserve the right to send any checks drawn on a foreign 
financial institution (including Canadian financial institutions) for 
collection. For each item sent, we will assess a collection charge 
plus any collection fees charged to us by other financial institutions 
which process the item as listed in our most recent Personal Fee 
Schedule. While the funds represented by checks that are sent for 
collection are generally available within thirty (30) Calendar Days or 
subject to payment by the Drawee bank, items sent for collection 
will be credited to your Account in U.S. dollars, with the amount 
of U.S. dollars credited calculated using our applicable exchange 
rate that is in effect on the date when we credit the funds to your 
Account and not when the deposit is made. If we do not enter 
any item (Canadian only) for collection, the funds will be available 
no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the day of deposit. 

Returned Items Subsequent to Availability 
of Funds 
If a check or other item you deposited to your Account is returned 
to us unpaid after the funds have been made available to you, 
the amount of the check or other item will be deducted from 
your Account. If there are insufficient funds in your Account, 
we reserve the right to demand payment directly from you and 
to charge you for the overdraft as posted in our most recent 
Personal Fee Schedule. 

Endorsements 
Endorsements on items deposited to your Account are restricted, 
under federal law, to the first 1.5 inches of the back of the check. 
The remaining portion of the check is reserved for endorsements 
by banks. Your endorsement should contain your signature, the 
words “For Deposit Only,” and your Account number. Improper 
endorsements may delay the check collection process and the 
subsequent crediting and availability of funds. While we may accept 
non-conforming endorsements, you agree you will be responsible 
for any losses. 

Part IV: Electronic Funds Transfers 
Disclosure 
The Electronic Funds Transfers (“EFT”) we are capable of handling 
are indicated below. Some of these may not apply to your 
Account. Please read this disclosure carefully because it tells you 
your rights and obligations for these transactions. You should 
keep this notice for future reference. 

Use of your ATM or Visa® Debit Card may be restricted in certain 
countries due to security risks. 

For security purposes, your card may be canceled at any time 
without notice to you. 

Direct Deposits 
You may make arrangements for certain direct deposits to be 
accepted into your Checking, Statement Savings or Statement 
Money Market Deposit Accounts. 

Pre-authorized Withdrawals 

You may make arrangements to pay certain recurring bills from 

your Checking, Statement Savings or Statement Money Market 

Deposit Accounts. 

Telephone Transfers 

You may make arrangements to have telephone transfers between 

eligible Checking, Statement Savings or Statement Money Market 

Deposit Accounts through our telephone banking system. 

Electronic Check Conversions 

Some Point-of-Purchase terminals may provide you the option 

of initiating a one-time automatic debit from your Account by 

authorizing the merchant to obtain the necessary information 

from a check drawn on your Deposit Account. A check used in 

this way is treated as an EFT and is not a negotiable instrument 

in its own right. The check cannot be subsequently used and 

should be voided. 

You may authorize a merchant or other payee to make a one-

time electronic payment from your Checking Account using 

information from your check to: 

• Pay for purchases 

• Pay bills 

Bill Pay 

You may use this service to pay your bills with a mobile device or 

online with a Checking Account or Money Market Account with 

check access.

credits will be deposited. Personal Checking, Money Market or 

Savings Accounts are typically eligible.

Termination 
You may terminate the Electronic Funds Transfers Agreement by 
calling us and subsequently providing written notice. The Bank 
may terminate the Electronic Funds Transfers Agreement by 
notifying you in writing. 

Charges For Electronic Funds Transfers 
We will impose a fee, as disclosed on the Personal Fee Schedule, 
for Account transactions you conduct at an ATM that we do not 
own or operate. Such transactions are referred to as “non-TD” 
ATM transactions. Fees imposed by TD Bank for non-TD ATM 
transactions will be reflected in your monthly statement and are 
charged per transaction. Each transfer, each withdrawal and each 
balance inquiry is a separate transaction. For example, if you make 
two withdrawals and you obtain a balance at a non-TD ATM, 
then you will be charged three transaction fees. Currently, the 
transaction fee is $3.00. In this example, you would be assessed 
total transaction fees of $9.00. These fees are in addition to any 
fees (“surcharge”) that the owner and/or operator of the non-TD 
ATM may charge you. 

Please note: For non-TD ATM transactions, the owner and/or 
operator of the ATM (or the network) may assess a surcharge at 
the time of your transaction, including for balance inquiries. In 
certain instances, we will reimburse this surcharge. 

International ATM Surcharge Fee for Accounts that Qualify  
for Surcharge Refunds: When we process an international 
ATM transaction and the fee is presented separately, we will 
refund the ATM surcharge fee assessed. If we do not receive 
the fee separately, we will refund the surcharge fee assessed if 
you bring us your ATM receipt within ninety (90) Calendar Days 
of the transaction. Reimbursement is subject to the balance 
requirements as disclosed on the Personal Fee Schedule. 

International ATM Card or Visa®  Debit Card Transactions:  
The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the 
billing currency used for processing international ATM Card or 
Visa Debit Card transactions is a rate selected by Visa from the 
range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the 
applicable central processing date, which may vary from the rate 
Visa itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect 
for the applicable central processing date. 

Whenever you use your TD Bank Debit Card or TD ATM Card 
outside of the United States to get cash at any non-TD ATM, or to 
purchase goods or services, or for cash advances, we will charge 
an International transaction fee equal to 3% of the transaction 
amount. This fee will apply whether the TD Bank Debit Card 
holder or TD ATM Card holder is physically located inside or 
outside the United States and the merchant is located outside 
the United States or makes a purchase in a foreign currency or 
in US currency. 

Certain types of accounts may receive a waiver of one of the fees 
outlined above. Please refer to the Personal Fee Schedule for 
more details on waivers for certain types of accounts. 

Right To Documentation 

Terminal Transactions 
You can get a receipt at the time you conduct a transaction 
using ATM or point-of-sale terminals, unless your transaction 
totals $15.00 or less. 

Direct Deposits 
If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your 
Account at least once every sixty (60) Calendar Days from the 
same person or company, you can call us at 1-888-751-9000 to 
find out whether the deposit has been made. 

Periodic Statements 
You will get a monthly Account statement from us for your 
Checking, Statement Savings, and/or Statement Money Market 
Accounts unless there are no checks written or no electronic 
transfers in a particular month. You will receive a statement at 
least quarterly for all Accounts except Club, IRA, Passbook, or 
CD Accounts, and Checking Accounts that have been inactive for 
more than 6 months or Savings Accounts that have been inactive 
for more than 9 months. 

Passbook Accounts Where the Only Possible Electronic 
Funds Transfers Are Direct Deposits 
If you bring your Passbook to us, we will record any electronic 
deposits that were made since the last time you brought in your 
Passbook. Passbook Accounts are not available in all states. 

Notice of Varying Amounts 
If these regular payments may vary in amount, the person (or 
organization) you are going to pay will tell you, at least ten (10) 
Calendar Days before each payment, when it will be made and 
how much it will be. You may choose instead to get this notice 
only when the payment would differ by more than a certain 
amount from the previous payment, or when the amount would 
fall outside certain limits that you set. 

Pre-authorized (Recurring) Transfers and Stop 
Payments 
If you have authorized a merchant to bill charges to your Visa 
Debit Card on a recurring basis, it is your responsibility to notify 
the merchant in the event your Visa Debit Card is replaced, 
your Visa Debit Card number or expiration date changes, or the 
applicable account from which payments are debited has been 
closed. However, if we issue you a replacement Visa Debit Card 
we may provide your new Visa Debit Card number and expiration 
date to a merchant with whom you have set up a recurring 
pre-authorized payment, and you authorize us to apply such

recurring charges to your Visa Debit Card until you notify the 
merchant or us that you have revoked authorization for charges 
to your Visa Debit Card. 

If you have Recurring Pre-authorized Visa Debit Card Payments 
made from your Account(s) on a regular basis, you can request 
a stop payment by visiting one of our TD Bank Stores or calling 
us at 1-888-751-9000. 

Pre-authorized ACH transfers from your Account(s) can be 
discontinued, for a fee (see Personal Fee Schedule), by visiting 
one of our TD Bank Stores, calling us at 1-888-751-9000, or 
using secure online banking at td.com. If your Stop Payment 
request has been made orally, the Bank will send you a written 
confirmation. If your Stop Payment request is made in writing, 
you must use a form that is supplied by the Bank; this form will 
constitute written confirmation of your request. In either case, it 
is your responsibility to ensure that all of the information supplied 
on your written confirmation is correct and to promptly inform 
the Bank of any inaccuracies. 

To be effective, a Stop Payment request must be received at 
least three (3) Business Days prior to the regularly scheduled 
payment date. Your Stop Payment request will be effective after 
the request has been received by the Bank and the Bank has had 
a reasonable opportunity to act on it. 

If you order us to stop one of these payments three (3) Business 
Days or more before the transfer is scheduled, and we do not 
do so, we will be liable for your losses or damages. 

Additional Information Required By Massachusetts Law 

a) Any documentation provided to you which indicates an 
electronic fund transfer was made shall be admissible as 
evidence of the transfer and shall constitute prima facie proof 
that the transfer was made. 

b)  Unless otherwise provided in the Agreement, you may not stop 
payment of electronic fund transfers, therefore you should not 
employ electronic access for purchases or services unless you 
are satisfied that you will not need to stop payment. 

EFT: Our Liability 
If we do not complete a transfer to or from your Account on time 
or in the correct amount according to our Agreement with you, 
we will be liable for losses or damages. However, there are some 
exceptions. We will NOT be liable for instance: 

a) If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money 
in your Account to make the transfer. 

b) If the transfer would go over the credit limit on your overdraft line. 

c) If the ATM where you are conducting the transfer does not 
have enough cash. 

d) If the terminal or system was not working properly and you 
knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer. 

e) If circumstances beyond our control prevent the transfer, 
despite reasonable precautions we have taken. Such 
circumstances include telecommunications and power 
outages or interruptions, postal strikes, delays caused by 
payees, fires and floods. 

f) If the funds are subject to legal process or other encumbrances 
restricting such transfer. 

g) If the transfer would result in your daily withdrawal limit being 
exceeded. 

h) If the Bank has reason to believe that you or someone else 
is using the ATM or other electronic banking service for 
fraudulent or illegal purposes. 

i) If you do not give proper, complete or correct instructions 
for the transfer, or you do not follow the procedures in this 
Agreement or any other Agreement with us for requesting 
the transfer. 

j)   If your ATM or Visa® Debit Card and/or your PIN has been 
reported lost or stolen, or we have canceled your PIN, your 
Card, or otherwise terminated this Agreement. 

There may be other exceptions stated in our Agreement with you. 

Disclosures of Account Information to Third Parties 
In order that your privacy may be protected, we will not disclose 
any information about you or your Account to any person, 
organization, or agency except: 

a) For certain routine disclosures necessary for the completion 
of a transfer or to resolve errors; or 

b) For verification of the existence and condition of your Account 
for a credit bureau or merchant; or 

c) To persons authorized by law in the course of their official 
duties; or 

d) To our employees, auditors, service providers, attorneys or 
collection agents in the course of their duties; or 

e) Pursuant to a court order or lawful subpoena; or 

f) To a consumer reporting agency; or 

g) To update your Account or Card information with the card 
network; or 

h) To certain third parties with whom we have joint marketing 
agreements; or 

i) To our affiliates as permitted by law; or 

j) By your written Authorization which, for Massachusetts 
Customers only, shall automatically expire forty-five (45) days 
after our receipt of your authorization. 

For Massachusetts Customers only: If an unauthorized disclosure 
has been made, we must inform you within three (3) days after 
we have discovered that an unauthorized disclosure has occurred.

Unauthorized Transfers 
Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your Card, your PIN, or both has 
been lost, stolen or used without your permission, or if you believe 
that an Electronic Funds Transfer has been made without your 
permission using information from your check. You could lose all 
the money in your Deposit Account, plus your available overdraft 
protection. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible 
losses down. If you notify us within two (2) Business Days after 
you learn of the loss or theft of your Card or PIN, you can lose no 
more than $50 if someone uses your Card or PIN without your 
permission. If you do not notify us within two (2) Business Days 
after you learn of the loss or theft of your Card or PIN, and we can 
prove we could have prevented someone from using your Card 
and/or PIN without your permission if you had told us, you could 
lose as much as $500 ($50 if you are a resident of Massachusetts 
and this Agreement is governed by Massachusetts law). You will 
not be liable for unauthorized purchases made with your Debit 
Card when used as if it were a Visa® Credit Card. However, you 
can be held liable for fraudulent use of your Card and/or PIN when 
PIN-based transactions are made with your ATM or Debit Card. 

Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, 
notify us at once. If you do not notify us within sixty (60) Calendar 
Days after the statement was mailed or electronically delivered 
to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the sixty 
(60) Calendar Days if we can prove that we could have stopped 
someone from taking the money if you had told us in time. (If you 
are a resident of Massachusetts and this Agreement is governed 
by Massachusetts law, the maximum amount of money you could 
lose is $50.) If a good reason (such as a long trip or hospital stay) 
kept you from notifying us, we will extend the time periods. 

If you believe your Card and/or your PIN has been lost or stolen, 
someone has transferred or may transfer money from your 
Account without your permission, or a transfer has been made 
using the information from your check without your permission, 
call us at 1-888-751-9000, or write: 
Customer Service Department 
Mail Stop NJ5-002-215 
6000 Atrium Way 
Mt. Laurel, NJ 08054 

Business Days: Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. 

Errors or Questions About Electronic Funds Transfers 
If you need information about an Electronic Funds Transfer or if 
you believe there is an error on your bank statement or receipt 
relating to an Electronic Funds Transfer, telephone the Bank 
immediately at 1-888-751-9000 or write to: 

Deposit Operations Department 
P.O. Box 1377 
Lewiston, ME 04243-1377 
We must hear from you no later than sixty (60) Calendar Days 

after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the problem or 
error appeared. When contacting the Bank, please provide us 
with the following information: 

a) Tell us your name and Account number. 

b) A description of the error or transaction you are unsure about. 
Please explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is 
an error or why more information is needed. 

c) The dollar amount of the suspected error. 

When making a verbal inquiry, the Bank may ask that you send 
us your complaint in writing within ten (10) Business Days after 
the verbal inquiry. If we ask you to put your complaint or question  
in writing and we do not receive it within ten (10) Business Days, 
we may not provisionally credit your Account. 

We will complete our investigation within ten (10) Business  
Days after we hear from you (or within twenty (20) Business  
Days after we hear from you if your notice relates to a transfer 
that occurred within thirty (30) Calendar Days after your first 
deposit to the Account). If we need more time, however, we 
may take up to forty-five (45) Calendar Days to investigate your 
complaint or question. We may take up to ninety (90) Calendar 
Days to investigate your complaint or question if it relates to a 
transaction you initiated through point-of-sale, from outside the 
United States, or a transaction which occurred within thirty (30) 
Calendar Days after your first deposit to the Account. If we decide  
to do this, we will credit your Account for the amount you think 
is in error within ten (10) Business Days (or, twenty (20) Business 
Days if your complaint or question relates to a transfer which 
occurred within thirty (30) Calendar Days after your first deposit 
to the Account), so that you will have use of the money during 
the time it takes us to complete our investigation. 

We will correct any error promptly after we complete our 
investigation. We will send you a written explanation within three 
(3) Business Days after completing our investigation. You may ask 
for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation and 
we must make these available to you for inspection. 

Part V: Substitute Checks and Your Rights 
What is a Substitute Check? 
To improve the way checks are processed, federal law permits 
banks to replace original checks with “substitute checks”. These 
checks are similar in size to original checks with a slightly reduced 
image of the front and back of the original check. The front of 
a substitute check states: “This is a legal copy of your check. 
You can use it the same way you would use the original check.” 
You may use a substitute check as proof of payment just like the 
original check. Some or all of the checks that you receive back 
from us may be substitute checks. This notice describes rights you 
have when you receive substitute checks from us. The rights in 
this notice do not apply to original checks or to electronic debits 

52 53 



 
 

 

  
 

  
 
 

 

         

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 
 

to your Account. However, you have rights under other law with 
respect to those transactions. 

What are my Rights Regarding Substitute Checks? 
In certain cases, federal law provides a special procedure that 
allows you to request a refund for losses you suffer if a substitute 
check is posted to your Account (for example, if you think that 
we withdrew the wrong amount from your Account or that we 
withdrew money from your Account more than once for the 
same check). The losses you may attempt to recover under this 
procedure may include the amount that was withdrawn from your 
Account and fees that were charged as a result of the withdrawal 
(for example, bounced check fees). The amount of your refund 
under this procedure is limited to the amount of your loss or the 
amount of the substitute check, whichever is less. You are also 
entitled to interest on the amount of your refund if your Account 
is an interest-bearing Account. If your loss exceeds the amount 
of the substitute check, you may be able to recover additional 
amounts under other law. If you use this procedure, you may 
receive up to $2,500 of your refund (plus interest if your Account 
earns interest) within ten (10) Business Days after we received 
your claim and the remainder of your refund (plus interest if your 
Account earns interest) not later than forty five (45) Calendar Days 
after we received your claim. We may reverse the refund (including 
any interest on the refund) if we later are able to demonstrate 
that the substitute check was correctly posted to your Account. 

How Do I Make a Claim for a Refund? 
If you believe that you have suffered a loss relating to a substitute 
check that you received and that was posted to your Account, 
please contact us at 1-888-751-9000. You must contact us within 
forty (40) Calendar Days of the date that we mailed (or otherwise 
delivered by a means to which you agreed) the substitute check 
in question or the Account statement showing that the substitute 
check was posted to your Account, whichever is later. We will 
extend this time period if you were not able to make a timely claim 
because of extraordinary circumstances. Your claim must include: 

a) A description of why you have suffered a loss (for example,
you think the amount withdrawn was incorrect);

b) An estimate of the amount of your loss;

c) An explanation of why the substitute check you received is
insufficient to confirm that you suffered a loss; and

d) A copy of the substitute check and/or the following
information to help us identify the substitute check: check
number, the name of the person to whom you wrote the
check, the amount of the check and the date posted on
your statement.

Part VI: Night Depository Agreement 
This Agreement governs the use of the night depository service of 
TD Bank, N.A. after September 1, 2011. By using this service after 

September 1, 2011, you agree to the terms of this Agreement. In 
this Agreement, the terms “you” and “your” refer to the Depositor 
and the terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer to TD Bank, N.A. 

Bags and Containers 
a) Disposable Bags – Effective September 1, 2011, all new

Depositors using the night depository service must make
deposits using the two-part disposable bags supplied by us
or by our vendor. The bags must only be used for the deposit 
of currency, coin and negotiable instruments owned by you.

b) Locking Bags, Zipper Bags, Envelopes and Other Containers 
– Existing Depositors using the night depository service may 
continue to use their existing locking bags, envelopes or
other containers.

c) All Bags, Envelopes and Containers – You must record the
contents of each bag, envelope or container on a deposit slip 
supplied or approved by us and place the deposit slip in the
bag, envelope or container.

Method of Deposit 
Deposits made pursuant to this Agreement are to be either (i) 
placed in a night depository facility (“night depository”) at one 
of our offices, or (ii) given directly to our employee at one of our 
offices during regular business hours without waiting for our 
employee to verify the amount of the deposit (“subject to count 
deposit”), or (iii) delivered to us via an armored carrier or by a 
courier service (a “Carrier”). 

Receipt of Bags and Keys 
You acknowledge receipt of any bank-supplied bags and any keys 
necessary to operate the exterior door of the night depository. 
Any lost keys must be reported to us immediately. 

Third Party Carriers 
We may arrange for and pay for a Carrier to collect deposits from 
you and deliver the deposits to us for processing. For any deposits 
made via a Carrier, you acknowledge and agree that (a) we do 
not own or control the Carrier, the Carrier’s employees or the 
Carrier’s facilities; (b) the Carrier retains discretion to determine 
what Customers and geographic areas it will serve and maintains 
the ultimate responsibility for scheduling, movement and routing; 
(c) the Carrier acts as your exclusive agent when items are in
transit and is responsible for the bags and their contents during
transit; and (d) the Carrier is responsible for maintaining adequate 
insurance covering theft, employee fidelity and other in-transit
losses. The items transported by the Carrier are considered
deposited only when actually received by us and verified and
credited to your Account.

is at your own risk. We will not be responsible for any loss or

damage sustained by you in the use of the night depository 
service resulting from any cause whatsoever, including mechanical 
defects or a malfunction of the night depository itself, unless such 
loss or damage is directly caused by our negligence or willful 
misconduct. In no event will we be liable for damages resulting 
from causes beyond our control or for consequential, special or 
punitive damages or for any lost profits. 

Contents Not Insured 
We do not insure the contents of any bag, envelope or container. 

Processing Deposits 
You give us authority to open the bags and process for deposit any 
coin, currency or negotiable instruments found in the bags. You 
acknowledge and agree that the deposit slip you provide is not 
conclusive as to the contents of the bags and the determination 
of our employee is conclusive as to the contents of the bags. Our 
Funds Availability Policy, as it may be amended from time to time, 
applies to all deposits. We may take up to two (2) Business Days 
following the day the bag is received to count the cash in the bag 
and to credit your Account based on our verified cash count. We 
will use ordinary care and adhere to the reasonable commercial 
standards of the banking business in connection with the receipt 
and processing of the contents of the bags. 

Fees and Service Charges 
You agree to pay all fees associated with this service as described 
in the Personal Fee Schedule. We may change those fees from 
time to time by giving you notice of such changes in the manner 
specified in the Personal Deposit Account Agreement or as may 
be required by applicable law. 

Termination 
This Agreement may be terminated by either you or by us 
immediately by giving oral or written notice to the other. Upon 
termination of this Agreement, you agree to return any key(s) to 
the night depository facility.

Agreement may be amended from time to time. All terms and conditions of the Personal Deposit Account Agreement 
apply, except as outlined below. 

Part III: Funds Availability 

Longer Delays May Apply 

In some cases, we will not make all the funds that you deposit by check available at the times shown in this policy. Depending on the 
type of check you deposit, funds may not be available until the second (2nd) Business Day after the day of your deposit. The first 
$225 of your deposit, however, will be available no later than the first (1st) Business Day after the day of your deposit. If we are not 
going to make all of the funds from your deposit available on the first (1st) Business Day, we will notify you at the time you make 
your deposit, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. We will also tell you when the funds will be available. If your deposit 
is not made directly to one of our employees, or if we decide to take this action after you have left the premises, we will mail you 
the notice by the day after we receive your deposit. If you will need the funds from a deposit right away, you should ask us when the 
funds will be available. 

In addition, funds deposited by check may be delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances: 
a) You deposit checks totaling more than $5,525 on any one-day (Note: The first $225 will be made available no later than the

first (1st) Business Day after the day of your deposit);
b) We believe a check you deposited will not be paid;
c) You re-deposit a check that has been returned unpaid;
d) You have overdrawn your Account repeatedly, or would have overdrawn your Account if checks had been

honored in the last six (6) months;
e) There is an emergency, such as failure of communications or computer equipment. (Note: The first $225 will be made

available no later than the first (1st) Business Day after the day of your deposit).

We will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for any of these reasons, and we will tell you when the funds will be 
available. They will generally be available no later than the seventh (7th) Business Day after the day of your deposit.
